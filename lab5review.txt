Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable



1. Show the cities of agents booking an order for a customer whose id is 
   'c002'. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect output
- You did not use joins.


2. Show the ids of products ordered through any agent who makes at least 
   one order for a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to 
   lowest. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect query
- You are hard-coding the specific number of customers 'c002' and 'c003', which
  is wrong. This will only work for this specific snapshot of the database and
  not for further snapshots. You need to use 'Dallas' as your baseline. Don't
  do this ever again. Sneaky!


6. Show the names of customers and agents living in the same city, along 
   with the name of the shared city, regardless of whether or not the 
   customer has ever placed an order with that agent.

Incorrect output
- You are missing the shared city.


7. Show the name and city of customers who live in the city that makes the 
   fewest different kinds of products. (Hint: Use count and group by on 
   the Products table.)

Incorrect output
- Missing customer names.




In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
