Evidence looks ok.

Good organization of screenshots.


2.

Minimum knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey. Please
review this concepts for the mid-term and final.


3.

You might have the wrong concept of what -nullable- means. Can a product have
no name?


4.

The ``frist normal form'' has nothing to do with primary keys. Please check
your notes and the textbook Chapter 6.1.

The ``access rows by content only'' rule explanation is wrong. Please check
your notes or the book Chapter 6.1.

The ``all rows must be unique'' rule is not entirely correct, this part is
wrong: ``must have a unique identifier''. Please check your class notes or
Chapter 6.1 of the textbook.
