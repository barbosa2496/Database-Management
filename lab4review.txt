Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  select distinct pid
  from orders
  where aid in (select aid 
  	      from orders
  	      where cid IN (select cid
  		            from customers
  		            where city = 'Dallas'))
  		            order by pid desc;
 do it like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here



4. Get the ids of customers who ordered both product p01 and p07.

Query is confusing. Please format your query for better reading.
- The intersection query is incorrectly indented. It gives the impression that
  is a subquery, but it is clearly not.

5. Get the ids of products not ordered by any customers who placed any order
through agent a07 in pid order from highest to lowest.

Query is hard to read. Please format your query for better reading.
- The ORDER BY is incorrectly indented


6. Get the name, discounts, and city for all customers who place orders through
agents in London or New York.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.


8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You discussed constraints, but not "check constraints". There is a
  difference. 


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- You submitted a text file, that was not runnable. The answer to no. 8 is
  incorrectly commented out.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
